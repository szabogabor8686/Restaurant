Hello,

my name is Gábor Szabó and this is my first project.
It is a static webpage for a fictional restaurant. I used html, scss and javascript. The page is optimized for two main screens, which are moblie and desktop, but I also checked many other resolution and I can say it looks good on every screen.
The UI is basic I think but I tried to make it look good and the seo is also simple containing the elementary parts. The hamburger menu is custom made with scss and js, the food and drink menu is using async functions to fetch the data from public APIs.
lso the errors are handled if the APIs are not available.
The galery is a slideshow but you can also change the pictures with the arrows and also with the dots below the pictures and then the slideshow continues after a short period of time.
Every input of the reservation has customized validators and the time options depend the selected date which is also regulated.
I used GitHub Copilot as well to help me fix minor issues and I always reviewed the suggestions and had to overwrite them most of the time, but I think it can be a good assist if one can place the suggestions well in the concept.
All details of the page is fictional, google maps points to the middle of nowhere and the source of the images were either ChatGPT or Unsplash, which I indicated in the footer as well.
Thank you for reading this and checking my first project.
